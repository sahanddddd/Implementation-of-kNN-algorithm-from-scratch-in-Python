# Implementation-of-kNN-algorithm-from-scratch-in-Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm in Python, a popular machine learning method for classification and regression tasks.

## Overview
The k-NN algorithm works by analyzing the distances between data points to make predictions based on the majority vote of the k-nearest neighbors. This implementation includes functions for calculating various distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, and cosine distance) and finding the k-nearest neighbors for a given data point.

## Features
Simple implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
Distance calculation using Euclidean, Manhattan, and cosine distance measures
Data preprocessing functions for MinMax scaling and standard scaling
Train and test dataset splitting
Data visualization through scatter plot matrices
Dependencies
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn (only for loading the example dataset)

## Usage
Clone the repository
Install the required dependencies
Import the necessary functions and libraries
Load your dataset and preprocess it (if necessary)
Apply the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to your dataset
